How to install?
---------------
Download Inchoo Flickr Gallery module files to your Magento root directory. Module files will be extracted into the base package / default template so if you have your own package just copy the module files to your package / template directories.

If you are logged in to your Magento back-end you have to log out and then log in again. Clearing the cache would also be a good idea.


Configuration
-------------
Inchoo Flickr Gallery module is made to be fully and easily configurable form Magento back-end. Just go to System -> Configuration -> Inchoo -> Flickr Gallery to find all the available configuration options.
To get started youâ€™ll need to have a Flickr API Key and User ID. Go to http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html to get your own Flickr API Key and http://idgettr.com/ for your User ID.
Once you enter your API Key and User ID save your configuration and you will get the list of all the photosets available for the user specified with the User ID. You can select all of them or just the ones you want to show on the site and save your configuration. That should be enough get the gallery up and running.
All the other configuration options are pretty straight forward with useful descriptions so there is no need to explain them separately.


How to access the gallery on the front-end?
-------------------------------------------
By default, Inchoo Flickr Gallery module adds a link to the footer but you can open the gallery directly at www.yoursite.com/gallery
